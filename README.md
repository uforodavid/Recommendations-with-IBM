## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
Installation of Python 3, Numpy, Pandas Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit learn libraries are sufficient to run the codes in the notebook. 

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
I was interested in building a regression model to predict selling price of cars in Kaggle's Car dataset and also find answers to the following questions:
1. Which features of a car has the most impact on the price of the car?
2. Does the distance covered by the cars before sale affect the price of cars?
3. Which is most expensive, diesel or petrol cars?
4. Which car brands are the most expensive?
5. Which gear transmission type is most expensive, automatic or manual?
5. Does age of cars from first purchase affect the selling price?

## Data Source <a name="source"></a>
The data for this project was gotten from Kaggle Used Vehicle Dataset from CarDekho. The data on Kaggle can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=car+data.csv)

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is one note book file that contains the exploratory data analysis and model building. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the process for individual steps.

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings and answers to the questions can be found on a blog post [here](https://uforodavid.medium.com/this-analysis-will-make-you-better-informed-for-your-next-car-purchase-3bdc147c7eec)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>
Must give credit to Kaggle for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=car+data.csv). feel free to use the code here!
